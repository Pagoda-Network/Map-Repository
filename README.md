# Files to Keep in a Map
- level.dat
- region
- map.xml
- map.png
- map_banner.png

## Pruning
Make sure to prune your map to where there are not excessive region files, and to where there are no outlying flatlands around your map. You can use [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net/) to ensure there are no problems with your map.
